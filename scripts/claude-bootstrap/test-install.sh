# Test suite for install.sh — the SessionStart bootstrap.
#
# The contract being pinned (developer ruling, 2026-08-06): **the repo is always the
# truth.** install.sh copies the three framework docs from the repo into ~/.claude
# UNCONDITIONALLY, every session, regardless of timestamps. The previous `cp -u`
# behaviour was timestamp-dependent and therefore nondeterministic: after a fresh
# clone every repo file is newer than the target, so it clobbered; after a hand-edit
# of the target it silently did nothing. Neither was chosen.
#
# The one thing unconditional copying must NOT do is destroy a pre-existing global
# framework with no way back — so a file that was there before this hook ever ran is
# snapshotted once to <name>.pre-bootstrap.bak, and that snapshot is never touched again.
