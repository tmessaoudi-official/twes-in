# twes-in Claude-container bootstrap — restores the developer's global reasoning framework into the
# EPHEMERAL remote container (a fresh ~/.claude every session), so the project CLAUDE.md's routing
# reference ("the global reasoning framework, ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md") resolves everywhere.
#
# Idempotent + conservative: `cp -u` copies only when the repo copy is NEWER than the target, so a
# hand-edited (newer) ~/.claude file on a real workstation is never clobbered. Silent no-op when
# already current. Wired as a SessionStart hook in .claude/settings.json; safe to run by hand.
#
# SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW: this script copies three documentation files INTO ~/.claude and does
# nothing else. It must never copy anything OUT of ~/.claude into the repo — ~/.claude.json holds the
# oauth account, userID and machineID, and the working tree is one `git add -A` away from history.
# (The upstream port this was adapted from did exactly that; the block was removed here on purpose.)
#
# The repo-native skills (.claude/skills/*) and agents (.claude/agents/*) need NO install — Claude
# Code reads them in place from the clone.
