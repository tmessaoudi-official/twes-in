<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  twes-in ADAPTATION (2026-07-29) of the pdfturbo container port (2026-07-27), which itself came
  from the developer's machine bundle `claude-setup-global-20260722` via the phorj port. The port's
  machinery (plain-text questions, reviewer-subagent certification, `var/claude/**` reports, the
  ≤5-agent cap) is kept verbatim; what was RE-GROUNDED is the domain. pdfturbo's PDF-editor hooks —
  export byte-identity claims, redaction burns, DOCX in-place saves, IndexedDB/`SCHEMA_VERSION`
  persistence, 3-locale key sync, canvas/jsdom test split — are gone, because twes-in has no
  analogue for them. What is load-bearing here instead: money and tax arithmetic, invoice/quote
  state machines, multi-tenant data isolation, API-contract stability for the Angular and Flutter
  clients, e-invoicing (Peppol / EN16931 / Factur-X) schema validity, PDF document rendering, and DB
  migration safety. These deltas OVERRIDE the body below wherever they conflict:

  1. QUESTIONS ARE PLAIN TEXT. `AskUserQuestion` TIMES OUT in this cloud container, so a gate that
     "asks" cannot fire. Every "invoke ask-human" below means: print the question, a minimal
     concrete example, numbered options, and the recommended option FIRST with its reason, as
     ordinary prose — then STOP and wait. Protocol: `.claude/skills/ask-human/SKILL.md`.
  2. NO `advisor()` HERE — the tool does not exist in this environment. Independent certification =
     fresh-context read-only reviewer subagents, run as the three twes-in lenses
     (`domain-correctness-reviewer`, `tenancy-security-reviewer`, `completeness-reviewer` — see
     `/converge`). All three are REAL agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` — spawn them by name
     via the Agent tool rather than re-describing their charter inline, so each lens's attack surface
     stays in one place. Self-grading is the last resort and MUST be disclosed as self-graded.
  3. REPORTS GO TO `var/claude/…` in the repo — gitignored via `/var`, survives
     compaction inside the session, never committed. NOT `~/.claude/projects/…`: that is wiped when
     the container is reclaimed, so a report written there is lost. Never `git add` a report regardless
     — being ignored is what keeps them out of history, not what makes staging them harmless.
  4. `--scope=global|both` IS REMOVED wherever it appears: `~/.claude/` in this container is
     GENERATED from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.
  5. ≤5 concurrent subagents (10 caused ~50% rate-limit failures upstream). Every pipeline agent
     writes its raw output to `var/claude/<stage>/raw/` BEFORE returning — autocompact fires at 80%
     here and in-conversation results do not survive it.
  6. PROJECT RULES WIN on any conflict: `/home/user/twes-in/CLAUDE.md`. It EXISTS and is
     authoritative — READ IT. It carries the licensing invariants, the certification ladder, the
     git-autonomy override, the architecture rules (hexagonal, framework-free `Domain/`), the quality
     gate, and the in-repo plan home (`docs/plans/<topic>.plan.md`, each plan carrying its own
     `## Decisions Log`). On any conflict with a delta above, CLAUDE.md wins.
  7. THREE TOOLCHAINS, NONE OF THEM BUILT YET. twes-in is a Symfony (PHP) REST API + an Angular
     admin front end + a Flutter mobile/desktop app, over Postgres, with Docker Compose for local
     dev. **Wave 0 landed on 2026-07-29**, so there IS a source tree now — but only part of one, and
     the shape matters: `api/src/Domain/` (money, pricing — framework-free, zero Composer
     dependencies), `api/src/Infrastructure/` (tenancy via PostgreSQL row-level security, clock,
     UUIDv7), four PHPUnit suites under `api/tests/`, and six gates in `scripts/gates/` with their own
     `test-gates.sh`. **Still absent:** the Symfony application, Doctrine, PHPStan and deptrac (every
     Composer dist URL is blocked by egress policy — `CLAUDE.md` § Gotchas), and the `admin/`,
     `mobile/` and `infra/` tiers, which are README stubs listing the tests and enforcers they owe.
     The repo also holds `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `VISION.md`, `LICENSE`, `LICENSING.md`,
     `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, four plan files under `docs/plans/` (one mandatory reading before any
     application code), `docs/spec/pricing-vectors.json`, `.claude/`,
     `scripts/claude-bootstrap/`, and `.gitignore`. Run the API tier with
     `cd api && php tools/bin/phpunit-12.phar`; the gates are plain PHP and bash and need nothing
     installed. So: never hardcode a build, test
     or lint command. Read `composer.json`, `package.json` and `pubspec.yaml` for the real script names
     (typically `vendor/bin/phpunit` / `vendor/bin/phpstan` / `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer` for the API,
     `npm run lint` / `npm run test` / `ng build` for Angular, `flutter analyze` / `flutter test`
     for the app — verify, do not assume). When the stack a step needs is absent, say so and skip
     the step. A finding invented about code that does not exist is worse than an empty report.
  8. CLEAN-ROOM, AND IT IS LEGALLY LOAD-BEARING. twes-in is *inspired by* Invoice Ninja, NOT forked
     from it. Read-only study clones live under `/tmp/xxx/` and are outside this repo: never copy
     code or text from them, never cite a `/tmp/xxx` path as project source, and never treat
     "upstream does it differently" as a finding on its own.

# /inspect — Project Health Inspector

Explore the project and surface issues, tech debt, and improvement opportunities. **Never auto-applies anything — this command only reads and reports.**

Use `--quick` (security + deprecations + error handling only), `--focus=<A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J>` (single lens), `--target=<path>` (analyze a specific directory), `--output=<file>` (explicit report path), `--vision` (after health agents complete, also spawn 10 vision proposal agents VA–VJ and append proposals to the same report). **`--scope=global|both` is REMOVED here** (adaptation): `~/.claude/` in this container is generated from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.

---

## Step 0: Setup

```bash
# --target picks the directory to inspect; there is no --scope here (see adaptation above).
TARGET="${target_arg:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}}"
# Reports live in the REPO under var/ (gitignored, survives compaction) — never in ~/.claude,
# which is wiped when the container is reclaimed. Never commit them.
REPO_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}"
INSPECT_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/var/claude/inspections"
mkdir -p "$INSPECT_DIR"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)
REPORT_PATH="${output_arg:-$INSPECT_DIR/$TODAY.md}"
PRIOR_REPORT=$(ls "$INSPECT_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -1 || true)
```

Announce: "Inspecting project: `$TARGET` → saving to `$REPORT_PATH`"
If `$PRIOR_REPORT` is non-empty, note its date for drift comparison.

**No `--scope` handling** (adaptation): a single pass over `$TARGET`. If a caller passes `--scope=global` or `--scope=both`, say plainly that the flag was removed for this repo and why, then run the project pass.

```bash
# Vision mode setup (only when --vision flag is set)
if [[ "${vision_flag:-}" == "true" ]]; then
  VISION_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/var/claude/visions"
  mkdir -p "$VISION_DIR"
  PRIOR_VISION=$(ls "$VISION_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -1 || true)
fi
```

## Step 1: Detect Project Context

Before spawning agents, read the project to understand what you're analyzing:

```bash
# Detect tech stack signals. twes-in is THREE stacks in one repo — find which of them exist:
ls "$TARGET"/{composer.json,package.json,pubspec.yaml,Makefile,docker-compose*.y*ml,*.sh} 2>/dev/null
for M in composer.json package.json pubspec.yaml; do find "$TARGET" -maxdepth 3 -name "$M" \
  -not -path '*/vendor/*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' 2>/dev/null; done
[[ -f "$TARGET/CLAUDE.md" ]] && head -60 "$TARGET/CLAUDE.md"
[[ -f "$TARGET/.claude/settings.json" ]] && cat "$TARGET/.claude/settings.json"
```

Summarize the tech stack in one sentence and **name which stacks are present**: the Symfony (PHP) REST API, the Angular admin front end, the Flutter app — plus Postgres and Docker Compose for local dev. Pass this to each agent as `PROJECT_TYPE`. Where a stack exists, read its manifest for the real script names instead of assuming them (`composer.json` scripts and `vendor/bin/*`; `package.json` scripts; `pubspec.yaml` plus `flutter analyze` / `flutter test`).

**Greenfield degradation — required.** If a stack is absent, say so in one line and let its agents report on what exists rather than on what it would contain. On 2026-07-29 Wave 0 landed a PARTIAL stack: the API tier's `Domain/` and `Infrastructure/` exist with four PHPUnit suites, and `scripts/gates/` holds six gates plus `test-gates.sh`. The Symfony application, Doctrine, PHPStan, deptrac and both client tiers do not. So a legitimate `/inspect` run reports on what exists and states plainly what does not — it must NOT report an empty tree, and it must NOT skip the API tier.

## Step 2: Spawn Analysis Agents

Respect flags before spawning:
- `--quick`: spawn only A (Security), C (Deprecations), D (Error Handling)
- `--focus=<X>`: spawn only that agent
- `--vision`: run all 10 health agents as normal; Step 2b spawns vision agents afterward
- Default: spawn in two sequential batches — **never exceed 5 concurrent LLM agents** (5 is the proven rate-limit ceiling; >5 causes ~50% failures):
  - **Batch 1**: spawn agents A–E in one message; wait for all 5 to complete before continuing
  - **Batch 2**: spawn agents F–J in one message; wait for all 5 to complete

Replace `<TARGET>` with the actual target path. Replace `PROJECT_TYPE` with the detected stack. Replace `CURRENT_DATE` with today's date.

---

**Agent A: Security**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for security issues. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) hardcoded secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, or credentials anywhere in source files — check strings matching patterns like `password=`, `api_key=`, `secret=`, `token=`, `AUTH_`; (2) unsafe shell patterns: `eval`, `$()` with user input, unquoted variables in shell commands that could enable injection; (3) files with world-readable permissions containing sensitive data; (4) URLs using `http://` where `https://` should be enforced; (5) Dockerfiles running as root unnecessarily; (6) any pattern that exposes sensitive data in logs, error messages, or output; (7) missing input validation at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, file paths); (8) multi-tenant isolation — any query, aggregate, export, file fetch or background job that reaches tenant-owned data without the tenant filter its neighbours apply (a cross-tenant read is P0, not P2); (9) payment and PII exposure — card data, gateway tokens/secrets, or customer identifiers reaching logs, exception messages, error responses or committed fixtures; unverified or non-idempotent payment-gateway webhook handlers. For each finding: exact file, line number, issue description, severity (P0=exploit risk or cross-tenant exposure, P1=data exposure, P2=bad practice), recommended fix. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent B: Dead Code & Unused Artifacts**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for dead code. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) functions defined but never called — grep for function definitions, then grep for each name to confirm it has callers; (2) variables declared but never read — especially readonly arrays/vars that are set but never iterated or referenced; (3) imported modules or sourced files that contribute nothing used; (4) files in the project that are never referenced by any other file, Makefile target, or documented workflow; (5) commented-out code blocks (vs. intentional commenting); (6) configuration keys or env vars defined but never consumed; (7) test files that test non-existent or already-deleted code. For each finding: exact file, approximate line, why it appears dead (no callers/no readers found), confidence level. Note: a function may be called dynamically — flag these as "possibly dead" not "dead". Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent C: Deprecations & Staleness**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for deprecated or outdated patterns. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) deprecated CLI flags, API calls, or library functions being used — check documentation/man pages where relevant; (2) package versions pinned to EOL or clearly outdated major versions (check package.json, pyproject.toml, Gemfile, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.); (3) deprecated shell constructs (backtick command substitution instead of `$()`, `[ ]` instead of `[[ ]]` in bash, `#!/bin/sh` when bash features are used); (4) Docker base images using deprecated tags (`:latest`, EOL distro versions, deprecated base images); (5) patterns superseded by better alternatives in the same codebase (e.g., old script does X manually while a new utility for X already exists); (6) CLAUDE.md or README sections referencing tools, commands, or files that no longer exist on disk. For each: file + line, what's deprecated, what to use instead. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent D: Error Handling**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for error handling gaps. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) shell scripts missing `set -e` or `set -euo pipefail` where failure should abort (check if errors silently continue); (2) commands whose exit codes are not checked — specifically: `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `curl`, `docker`, `git` in scripts where failure would corrupt state; (3) `2>/dev/null` that silently discards errors in critical paths (vs. intentional suppression); (4) error messages that are too generic to diagnose ("Error occurred", "Failed") — no context, no file/line, no cause; (5) missing trap handlers for cleanup on unexpected exit; (6) functions that return meaningless exit codes (always return 0 even on failure); (7) try/catch or error handling code that swallows the exception without logging; (8) timeout-less network calls (`curl` without `--connect-timeout`, Docker pulls that can hang forever). For each: file + line, type of gap, consequence if triggered, fix suggestion. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent E: Documentation & Comment Staleness**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for documentation issues. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) function/script comments that claim parameters, behavior, or side effects that no longer match the actual code — look for `# Args:`, `# Usage:`, `# Returns:` comments and verify them; (2) README or CLAUDE.md sections that reference files, commands, or paths that don't exist; (3) TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers with no ticket number, no date, and no owner — unactionable tech debt; (4) example commands in docs that are broken (wrong paths, deprecated flags, missing required args); (5) public-facing functions or commands with no documentation at all; (6) inline comments that describe WHAT the code does (redundant) vs WHY (missing). Count undocumented public interfaces. For each: file + line, issue type, severity, fix cost. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent F: Test Coverage Gaps**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for test coverage issues. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. First establish which stacks exist and what their real runners are by reading `composer.json`, `package.json` and `pubspec.yaml` — never name a command you have not seen in a manifest, and if a stack is absent say so instead of reporting its coverage as zero. Treat these as the business-critical paths that MUST have tests in this project: money and tax computation, invoice/quote/credit status transitions, payment application (partial, over-payment, refund, webhook replay), tenant scoping, e-invoicing document generation, and DB migrations. Find: (1) locate all test files (`tests/**` PHPUnit cases, `*.spec.ts`, `*_test.dart`, `*.test.sh`, etc.) and test directories; (2) for each major source module, check whether a corresponding test file exists; (3) identify business-critical code paths (parsing, validation, data transformation, error handling) that have no tests; (4) find test files that reference functions, files, or commands that no longer exist; (5) find tests that always pass trivially (no assertions, only `true` as the test body); (6) find test infrastructure that would fail to run (missing test runner, broken harness, missing fixtures). If no tests exist at all: flag this prominently. Produce: coverage map (module → has tests?), critical untested paths, broken test infrastructure. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent G: Configuration & Drift**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for configuration issues. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) env vars referenced in code that are not documented in README, .env.example, or CLAUDE.md — undocumented requirements; (2) settings/config values that CLAUDE.md or README says should be X but the actual file shows Y; (3) .env.example or .env files that are missing entries that appear in the code; (4) hard-coded values that should be configurable (ports, paths, timeouts, limits appearing as magic numbers); (5) config files with duplicate keys or conflicting settings; (6) permission settings (e.g., settings.json) that reference files/scripts not present on disk; (7) COMPOSE_FILE or similar aggregation files with entries pointing to non-existent paths; (8) per-stack configuration drift — the API's env contract, the Angular app's build-time environment config and the Flutter app's compile-time config each declare things separately, so look for a value that must agree across two of them (API base URL, currency/locale defaults, feature flags, tenant resolution mode) and does not, and for secrets that are configured per stack but documented in only one. For each: file + line, drift description, impact. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent H: Code Quality & Consistency**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for code quality issues. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) functions longer than 60 lines that should be decomposed; (2) naming inconsistency — same concept named differently in different files (e.g., `get_user` vs `fetch_user` vs `load_user` for the same operation); (3) copy-pasted blocks (3+ consecutive identical or near-identical lines appearing in 2+ places — should be extracted); (4) functions doing multiple unrelated things (violates single responsibility — detectable by AND in the function name or multiple distinct logic phases); (5) circular dependencies or unusual coupling (A calls B calls A, or a "utility" module importing from a "domain" module); (6) magic numbers/strings without named constants; (7) inconsistent error handling patterns across similar functions in the same module. For each: file + line, issue type, fix suggestion. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent I: Performance Anti-Patterns**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for obvious performance issues. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) loops that re-read a file or re-run a command on every iteration when the result could be cached before the loop; (2) sequential network calls that could be parallelized (multiple `curl` or `docker pull` calls in sequence); (3) parsing or processing the same file twice in the same script when one pass would do; (4) missing caching for expensive operations that are called repeatedly with the same inputs; (5) large file reads into memory when streaming would work; (6) Docker layers ordered incorrectly (frequently changing layers early, causing unnecessary cache invalidation); (7) `find` or `grep -r` commands in loops; (8) sync operations blocking on a slow external call when async is possible. For each: file + line, bottleneck type, estimated impact, fix suggestion. Research only, no writes.

---

**Agent J: Tech Debt Markers**

> Analyze `<TARGET>` for explicit tech debt. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. Find: (1) every TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, WORKAROUND, NOTE:, KLUDGE comment — list file + line + full comment text; (2) commented-out code blocks (more than 3 lines) that are not explanatory — these are usually code someone was afraid to delete; (3) version-gated blocks ("# TODO: remove when X reaches version Y") where that version has now been surpassed; (4) workaround comments that reference external bugs or issues (e.g., "# workaround for docker bug #1234") — check if the upstream issue is resolved; (5) `sleep` calls used as synchronization workarounds instead of proper polling. Produce a ranked list: items where the condition has been met (can act now) vs items still pending. Research only, no writes.

---

## Step 2b: Spawn Vision Agents VA–VJ (only when `--vision` is set)

*Skip this entire step if `--vision` was NOT passed. Proceed directly to Step 3.*

After all Step 2 inspection agents complete, spawn these 10 vision agents in **two sequential batches of 5** (same cap as health agents — never exceed 5 concurrent LLM agents per Rule 4). They focus on improvement proposals, not current issues. Pass `PROJECT_TYPE` and `CURRENT_DATE` (already detected in Step 1).

- **Vision Batch 1**: spawn VA–VE in one message; wait for all 5 to complete
- **Vision Batch 2**: spawn VF–VJ in one message; wait for all 5 to complete

---

**Vision Agent VA: Architecture & Design Patterns**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements, not diagnose current issues. Propose architectural improvements: (1) evaluate the current dominant design pattern — is it the right fit for this project's size and goals? (2) identify missing layers (data access / business logic separation, abstractions over tool calls); (3) find tightly coupled modules where a simple adapter would reduce coupling; (4) would event-driven patterns improve anything? (5) is there a shared abstraction that would unify currently-duplicated patterns? (6) would a plugin architecture add value? For each proposal: title, current state, proposed state, concrete 3-5 step implementation, expected benefit, effort [Quick ≤1h / Medium 1-4h / Long >4h]. Research only, no writes.

---

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements. Propose observability improvements: (1) structured logging if not present; (2) progress indicators for long-running operations; (3) explicit success/failure markers for operations that could fail silently; (4) a health-check mechanism if missing; (5) a session/run report generated automatically; (6) metrics worth tracking (build times, test durations, latencies); (7) centralized log location and rotation strategy. For each: title, current gap, proposed addition, implementation sketch, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VD: Testing Strategy**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements. Propose testing improvements: (1) what test types exist vs. what's missing for this project's risk profile? (2) a target test coverage strategy — which modules MUST have tests? (3) integration tests to add for common failure modes; (4) property-based testing or fuzzing for input-parsing functions; (5) a test naming and organization convention if missing; (6) test fixtures or data factories to reduce duplication; (7) a fast smoke-test suite (< 30s) for quick feedback loops. For each: title, current state, proposed state, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VE: Developer Experience**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements. Propose developer experience improvements: (1) reduce "clone → first successful run" time; (2) commonly-needed commands with no shortcut; (3) is `.env.example` complete? (4) a "getting started in 5 minutes" README section if missing; (5) error messages that require reading source to understand; (6) a `make help` or `--help` for discoverability; (7) a Makefile or justfile for multi-step workflows; (8) automated local tooling installation. For each: title, current friction, proposed improvement, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VF: Naming & Consistency**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements. Propose naming and consistency improvements: (1) naming conventions in use — check for inconsistency (snake_case vs camelCase vs kebab-case); (2) ambiguous or generic names (handle, process, data, info, result); (3) files whose name doesn't match content; (4) a consistent naming convention if undocumented; (5) abbreviations used inconsistently (cfg vs config vs configuration); (6) prefix/suffix patterns not applied consistently. For each: current name, proposed name, files affected, effort [Quick]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VG: Security Hardening**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose proactive security improvements (not current vulnerabilities — those are for health agents). Propose: (1) trust boundary validation where inputs from external sources lack validation; (2) secrets management improvements (env var → secrets manager, .env.secret files); (3) SBOM for dependency tracking; (4) least-privilege Docker container permissions; (5) automated secret scanning in pre-commit hooks; (6) a security review checklist specific to this project's risk surface. For each: title, current state, proposed improvement, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VH: Performance & Scalability**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements (not diagnose current anti-patterns — those are for health agents). Propose: (1) slowest operations that could be made faster with caching, parallelization, or algorithmic improvement; (2) operations that scale poorly with input size; (3) build/test/compile time improvements; (4) network calls that could be batched or made async; (5) a persistent cache for repeated expensive computations; (6) startup costs that could be deferred. For each: title, current characteristic, proposed improvement, expected speedup, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VI: Knowledge & Documentation**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements. Propose knowledge and documentation improvements: (1) "tribal knowledge" items that should be written down (complex workarounds, non-obvious decisions, surprising behavior); (2) missing operational runbooks (how to debug X, reset Y, upgrade Z); (3) Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for 3-5 past decisions; (4) an onboarding guide for a new developer; (5) a CHANGELOG workflow; (6) "why does this exist?" questions the code doesn't answer; (7) CLAUDE.md or README sections needing expansion. For each: title, knowledge gap, proposed addition, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

**Vision Agent VJ: Infrastructure & Reliability**

> Explore `<TARGET>`. PROJECT_TYPE. CURRENT_DATE. You are a vision agent — propose improvements. Propose infrastructure and reliability improvements: (1) single points of failure — how to degrade gracefully; (2) operations that should be idempotent but aren't; (3) retry logic with exponential backoff for network calls; (4) cleanup/teardown steps missing on error; (5) a "self-healing" mechanism for common failure modes; (6) documented rollback procedures for destructive operations; (7) health checks for long-running processes; (8) proper wait/poll loops replacing sleep-based synchronization. For each: title, current fragility, proposed improvement, effort [Quick/Medium/Long]. Research only, no writes.

---

After all agents complete, synthesize into a structured report:

```markdown
# /inspect Report — <DATE>
Generated: <DATE> | Project: <TARGET> | Stack: <PROJECT_TYPE>
Prior inspection: <PRIOR_DATE or "none">

## Findings (P0 and P1 only — reply "details" for P2/P3)

### [P0|P1] — [Title] — Category X
**File**: `path/to/file:line`
**Issue**: [precise description]
**Impact**: [consequence if not fixed]
**Fix**: [concrete fix, 1-3 steps]
**Effort**: [Low <15min | Medium 15-60min | High >1h]

### Roadmap
**This week** (Quick ≤1h): [list]
**This sprint** (Medium 1–4h): [list]
**This quarter** (Long >4h): [list]
```

**Severity guide:**
- **P0**: Exploit risk, data loss, or silent corruption — fix before next commit
- **P1**: Breaks correctness, exposes data, or actively misleads — fix this sprint
- **P2**: Reduces quality, creates future bugs, or wastes time — fix when near
- **P3**: Stylistic, minor, or optional — fix opportunistically

**Chronic rule**: Any finding present in 2+ prior inspections gets bumped to P0/P1 regardless of original severity.

## Step 4: Save Report

Write the synthesized report to `$REPORT_PATH`.
Also write a JSON summary to `$INSPECT_DIR/latest.json`:
```json
{"date": "<DATE>", "target": "<TARGET>", "p0": N, "p1": N, "p2": N, "p3": N, "proposals": N, "report": "<path>"}
```
(`proposals` = total vision proposals count; 0 if `--vision` not set)

Announce: "Report saved to `$REPORT_PATH`"

## Step 4b: Self-Reflection (about this command, not the project)

Spawn ONE agent to reflect on this command's own definition using the just-saved report as evidence:

> Read `.claude/skills/inspect/SKILL.md` in full (repo-native — this skill is committed, not installed). You are auditing this command — not the project it just analyzed. Then read the report at the path provided to you. Based on what was actually found this run, produce ONLY this block:
>
> ---
> ### Command Self-Reflection — `/inspect`
> *Proposals only. Nothing auto-applies — user reviews and accepts or rejects each.*
>
> **Blind Spots** *(findings this run that no current agent prompt, A–J, was designed to catch)*
> For each: finding summary → which agent's stated scope it fell under → why the prompt missed it.
> Write "None detected" if all findings were anticipated by existing prompts.
>
> **Prompt Drift** *(agents that overreached or underdelivered vs. their stated scope)*
> For each: agent letter → what drifted → proposed one-sentence fix.
> Write "None detected" if all agents stayed on scope.
>
> **Missing Coverage** *(project health dimensions with no agent at all in A–J)*
> For each: missing dimension → why it matters → 1-sentence agent prompt sketch.
> Write "None" if all key health dimensions are covered.
>
> **Proposed Changes** *(max 3 — P1=high value / P2=quality improvement / P3=nice-to-have)*
> | # | Priority | Change | Rationale |
> |---|----------|--------|-----------|
> Write "No changes proposed this run." if nothing to add.
> ---
>
> After drafting your block above, append it to the report: read `$REPORT_PATH`, then write the complete updated file (original content + your block) using the Write tool. Return only: "Self-reflection appended — [N] proposals."

Pass the actual `$REPORT_PATH` value to the agent. The agent writes directly to the report — no inline display. Announce: "Self-reflection complete — see `$REPORT_PATH`"

## Step 5: Present Findings

Show in conversation:
- Summary table (all categories)
- All P0 and P1 findings in full
- Quick wins list
- Top 5 Actions
- If `--vision` was set: Vision Quick Wins table + Top 5 Vision Proposals
- **Close with a non-blocking offer** (twes-in adaptation — no interrupts). The report is the
  deliverable; do NOT end on a question that must be answered before anything is useful. State the
  report path, the P0/P1 count, and one line the developer can act on without replying, e.g.
  *"Full P2/P3 list and the vision proposals are in the report; say which finding IDs to fix and I'll
  take them."* Never auto-apply a fix — this skill only reads and reports.

*Nothing auto-applied. All findings are proposals.*
