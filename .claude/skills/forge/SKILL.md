<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  twes-in ADAPTATION (2026-07-29) of the pdfturbo container port (2026-07-27), which itself came
  from the developer's machine bundle `claude-setup-global-20260722` via the phorj port. The port's
  machinery (plain-text questions, reviewer-subagent certification, `var/claude/**` reports, the
  ≤5-agent cap) is kept verbatim; what was RE-GROUNDED is the domain. pdfturbo's PDF-editor hooks —
  export byte-identity claims, redaction burns, DOCX in-place saves, IndexedDB/`SCHEMA_VERSION`
  persistence, 3-locale key sync, canvas/jsdom test split — are gone, because twes-in has no
  analogue for them. What is load-bearing here instead: money and tax arithmetic, invoice/quote
  state machines, multi-tenant data isolation, API-contract stability for the Angular and Flutter
  clients, e-invoicing (Peppol / EN16931 / Factur-X) schema validity, PDF document rendering, and DB
  migration safety. These deltas OVERRIDE the body below wherever they conflict:

  1. QUESTIONS ARE PLAIN TEXT. `AskUserQuestion` TIMES OUT in this cloud container, so a gate that
     "asks" cannot fire. Every "invoke ask-human" below means: print the question, a minimal
     concrete example, numbered options, and the recommended option FIRST with its reason, as
     ordinary prose — then STOP and wait. Protocol: `.claude/skills/ask-human/SKILL.md`.
  2. NO `advisor()` HERE — the tool does not exist in this environment. Independent certification =
     fresh-context read-only reviewer subagents, run as the three twes-in lenses
     (`domain-correctness-reviewer`, `tenancy-security-reviewer`, `completeness-reviewer` — see
     `/converge`). All three are REAL agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` — spawn them by name
     via the Agent tool rather than re-describing their charter inline, so each lens's attack surface
     stays in one place. Self-grading is the last resort and MUST be disclosed as self-graded.
  3. REPORTS GO TO `var/claude/…` in the repo — gitignored via `/var`, survives
     compaction inside the session, never committed. NOT `~/.claude/projects/…`: that is wiped when
     the container is reclaimed, so a report written there is lost. Never `git add` a report regardless
     — being ignored is what keeps them out of history, not what makes staging them harmless.
  4. `--scope=global|both` IS REMOVED wherever it appears: `~/.claude/` in this container is
     GENERATED from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.
  5. ≤5 concurrent subagents (10 caused ~50% rate-limit failures upstream). Every pipeline agent
     writes its raw output to `var/claude/<stage>/raw/` BEFORE returning — autocompact fires at 80%
     here and in-conversation results do not survive it.
  6. PROJECT RULES WIN on any conflict: `/home/user/twes-in/CLAUDE.md`. It EXISTS and is
     authoritative — READ IT. It carries the licensing invariants, the certification ladder, the
     git-autonomy override, the architecture rules (hexagonal, framework-free `Domain/`), the quality
     gate, and the in-repo plan home (`docs/plans/<topic>.plan.md`, each plan carrying its own
     `## Decisions Log`). On any conflict with a delta above, CLAUDE.md wins.
  7. THREE TOOLCHAINS — THE API PARTLY BUILT, BOTH CLIENTS SCAFFOLDED, INFRA NOT STARTED. twes-in is a Symfony (PHP) REST API + an Angular
     admin front end + a Flutter client for all six targets
     (Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, macOS, Web — its Web build is a SECOND admin interface alongside
     the Angular one), over Postgres, with Docker Compose for local
     dev. **Wave 0 landed on 2026-07-29**, so there IS a source tree now — but only part of one, and
     the shape matters: `api/src/Domain/` (money, pricing — framework-free, zero Composer
     dependencies), `api/src/Infrastructure/` (tenancy via PostgreSQL row-level security, clock,
     UUIDv7), four PHPUnit suites under `api/tests/`, and the gates in `scripts/gates/` with their own
     `test-gates.sh`. **Still absent:** the Symfony application, Doctrine, PHPStan and deptrac (every
     Composer dist URL is blocked by egress policy — `CLAUDE.md` § Gotchas), and the `infra/` tier, which
     is a README stub. **`admin/` and `mobile/` are SCAFFOLDED** (`ng new` on Angular 22 / Node 26.5.0,
     `flutter create` on Flutter 3.44.8 with all six platform directories) and each is green on its own
     toolchain — lint/analyze, unit tests, production build — but neither holds DOMAIN or TRANSPORT code yet — each does carry its branding seam, and Flutter its font/same-origin controls, with tests.
     The repo also holds `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `VISION.md`, `LICENSE`, `LICENSING.md`,
     `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, four plan files under `docs/plans/` (one mandatory reading before any
     application code), `docs/spec/pricing-vectors.json`, `.claude/`,
     `scripts/claude-bootstrap/`, and `.gitignore`. Run the API tier with
     `cd api && php tools/bin/phpunit-12.phar`; the gates are plain PHP and bash and need nothing
     installed. So: never hardcode a build, test
     or lint command. Read `composer.json`, `package.json` and `pubspec.yaml` for the real script names
     (typically `vendor/bin/phpunit` / `vendor/bin/phpstan` / `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer` for the API,
     `npm run lint` / `npm run test` / `ng build` for Angular, `flutter analyze` / `flutter test`
     for the app — verify, do not assume). When the stack a step needs is absent, say so and skip
     the step. A finding invented about code that does not exist is worse than an empty report.
  8. CLEAN-ROOM, AND IT IS LEGALLY LOAD-BEARING. twes-in is *inspired by* Invoice Ninja, NOT forked
     from it. Read-only study clones live under `/tmp/xxx/` and are outside this repo: never copy
     code or text from them, never cite a `/tmp/xxx` path as project source, and never treat
     "upstream does it differently" as a finding on its own.

# /forge — Adversarial Design Critic

Interrogates structural decisions in a codebase and demands justification. Applies Chesterton's Fence as a gate: if a structural choice cannot be justified by git history, ADRs, or docs, it is challenged with a named principle, a concrete alternative, and a cost estimate. **Never auto-applies anything — this command only reads and reports.**

## Differentiation from related skills

- **`/inspect`** — diagnoses health issues (security, dead code, error handling, config drift). Produces a P0–P3 defect list. `/forge` interrogates *design decisions*, not defects.
- **`/inspect --vision`** — Vision Agent VA *proposes* architectural improvements (current state → proposed state). `/forge` *interrogates* the current state and demands justification before considering any alternative.
- **`/sleuth`** — hunts behavioral bugs: logic traps, silent failures, contract violations, timing issues. `/forge` does not look for runtime bugs — it challenges structural decisions that survive at compile time.

Use `/forge` when you want adversarial "why does this exist this way?" pressure on the codebase, not a defect list or improvement proposals.

---

Use `--quick` (agents A, B, D only — fastest signal-to-noise; bare `/forge` still runs all 9, see Step 0), `--focus=<A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I>` (single analysis lens + synthesis), `--target=<path>` (specific directory). `--scope=global|both` is REMOVED: `~/.claude/` in this container is generated from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.

---

## Step 0: Setup

```bash
TARGET="${target_arg:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}}"
# Reports live in the REPO under var/ (gitignored, survives compaction) — never ~/.claude,
# which is wiped when the container is reclaimed. Never commit them.
REPO_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}"
FORGE_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/var/claude/forge"
mkdir -p "$FORGE_DIR/raw"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)
REPORT_PATH="${output_arg:-$FORGE_DIR/$TODAY.md}"
PRIOR_REPORT=$(ls "$FORGE_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/raw/' | sort -r | head -1 || true)
```

Announce: "Forging: `$TARGET` → report: `$REPORT_PATH`"
If `$PRIOR_REPORT` is non-empty, note its date for comparison.

**Announce the cost, then run (twes-in adaptation — no stop).** Upstream halts here for confirmation;
this repo's standing directive is no interrupts, and the developer invoking `/forge` has already
chosen to pay for it. So print one line and proceed:

```
[forge] Large task — N analysis agents (≤5 concurrent) + 1 synthesis, writing to $FORGE_DIR/
```

Mode selection is by flag only, never by question: bare `/forge` → all 9 agents; `--quick` → A, B, D;
`--focus=<X>` → agent X + synthesis. If a caller passes `--scope=global|both`, say plainly that the
flag was removed for this repo and why, then run the project pass.

**Respect the ≤5-concurrency cap**: spawn the 9 agents in batches of at most 5, never all at once
(10 concurrent LLM agents caused ~50% rate-limit failures upstream).

## Step 1: Detect Project Context

```bash
ls "$TARGET"/{composer.json,package.json,pubspec.yaml,Makefile,docker-compose*.y*ml,*.sh} 2>/dev/null
[[ -f "$TARGET/CLAUDE.md" ]] && head -60 "$TARGET/CLAUDE.md"
```

Scan for design rationale in git: `git -C "$TARGET" log --oneline -50 2>/dev/null | grep -iE 'adr|decision|design|arch|refactor|rewrite|why|chose|chose|picked'`

Find the WHY corpus. **twes-in's lives in two places, and on 2026-07-29 both are nearly empty.** The
intended register is `docs/plans/<topic>.plan.md` — each plan carries its own `## Decisions Log`,
which is where a structural ruling is recorded — plus a `CLAUDE.md` § Gotchas section once that file
exists. Establish what the corpus actually contains before you challenge anything; the honesty of
this gate depends on it:

```bash
ls docs/plans/*.plan.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l            # plan files = the decision register
grep -n '## Decisions Log' docs/plans/*.plan.md 2>/dev/null | head -40
[[ -f CLAUDE.md ]] && wc -l CLAUDE.md || echo "no CLAUDE.md yet — no ruled invariants to cite"
[[ -f README.md ]] && wc -l README.md
git log --oneline -50 | grep -iE 'fix|refactor|revert|why'
```

**If that corpus comes back empty, say so and stop early.** A greenfield tree has almost no structure
to interrogate and no record to interrogate it against — under the gate below, nearly every finding
would fail the Chesterton check and be dropped anyway. Reporting "0 findings — no decision register
and the Symfony application layer is not built yet" is the correct output for the parts that do not exist — but Wave 0 DID land `api/src/Domain/`, `api/src/Infrastructure/` and `scripts/gates/`, so those are fair game and must not be waved off as absent; manufacturing structural criticism of code that
does not exist is the failure mode this skill is most prone to.

Three twes-in-specific rules for the Chesterton's Fence gate:

1. **A `## Decisions Log` entry IS a ruling.** If the choice you want to challenge is explained in a
   `docs/plans/<topic>.plan.md` decisions log (or, once it exists, in `CLAUDE.md` § Gotchas), it is
   **Justified by definition** — the developer decided it, usually after a real failure. Re-litigating
   it is the single worst output this skill can produce.
2. **A divergence from Invoice Ninja is not a design flaw.** twes-in is a clean-room reimplementation
   *inspired by* it, not a fork. "The reference implementation structures this differently" is never a
   finding on its own, and the read-only study clones under `/tmp/xxx/` are never cited as authority
   for how twes-in should be built.
3. **A guard in money, tax or tenancy code is a feature.** A service that refuses to mutate an issued
   invoice's totals, a repository that will not run unscoped, a tax path that rejects an unknown rate
   rather than defaulting to zero — these are accounting and isolation invariants. Proposing to "just
   allow" one without addressing the invariant it protects is a P0-grade misread.

Summarize in two lines: (1) tech stack sentence for `PROJECT_TYPE`; (2) ADR/design doc inventory for `ADR_CONTEXT` (e.g., "3 ADR files found at docs/adr/; relevant commits: …"). Pass both to every agent.

## Step 2: Spawn Analysis Agents

Respect flags before spawning:
- `--quick`: spawn only A, B, D
- `--focus=<X>`: spawn only that agent; proceed to Step 3 (synthesis) after it completes
- Default: two sequential batches — **never exceed 5 concurrent LLM agents**:
  - **Batch 1**: spawn A, B, C, D, E in one message; wait for all 5 to complete
  - **Batch 2**: spawn F, G, H, I in one message; wait for all 4 to complete

Replace `<TARGET>` with the actual target path. Replace `PROJECT_TYPE` and `ADR_CONTEXT` with the values from Step 1. Replace `CURRENT_DATE` with today's date. Replace `$FORGE_DIR` with the actual path.

**Every agent must write its raw output to `$FORGE_DIR/raw/<letter>.md` before returning.**

### Chesterton's Fence Protocol (applied inside every agent for every finding)

Before escalating any structural choice to Questionable or Unjustified:

1. Check git log (last 50 commits), ADR files, and inline docs for an explicit WHY.
2. Rationale found → verdict is **Justified** — note the rationale, stop. Do not report this finding.
3. Rationale not found → escalate **only if all 4 required fields are populated**:
   - **Named principle violated** — specific authority (e.g., Parnas/information hiding, Fowler/Shotgun Surgery, SOLID/SRP, Ousterhout/deep module)
   - **Concrete alternative** — one specific better structure with a 2-sentence implementation sketch
   - **Cost to change** — Low (< 1 day) / Medium (1–3 days) / High (> 3 days)
   - **Cost to keep** — coupling tax, cognitive tax, or evolution risk in one sentence

If any of the 4 fields cannot be populated → verdict defaults to **Justified** (drop the finding, do not report it). Incomplete challenges are noise.

---

### Paradigm auto-detection (per agent, per module)

Before applying principles, identify the dominant paradigm **per module**, not per project: "predominantly OOP", "predominantly FP", "procedural", or "mixed OOP/FP". Apply principles per-region:
- OOP regions: SOLID, composition vs. inheritance, DDD model richness
- FP regions: pure functions, immutability, referential transparency
- Suppress false positives (e.g., do not flag lack of classes in a functional module, do not flag mutation in a systems/scripting context where it is idiomatic)

---

**Agent A — Architecture & Inter-Module Structure**

OWNS: All cross-module structural concerns.
DELEGATES: single-module internal design → B; boundary/interface design → C.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial architecture critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN cross-module structure. If a finding is about one module's internal design, it belongs to B. If it is about what a module exposes at its boundary, it belongs to C.
>
> Auto-detect paradigm per module before applying principles.
>
> Interrogate: (1) Dependency direction — do dependencies flow toward stable, abstract modules? Any module depending on a more-volatile or more-concrete module? (2) Layer violations — does the dependency graph respect declared layers (presentation → domain → infrastructure)? Any upward dependency? (3) Conway's Law — does the module structure reflect the org/team structure, or would a different structure reduce coordination cost? (4) Connascence across module boundaries — are modules coupled by value (good), type, meaning/convention (bad), position (very bad), or algorithm (worst)? (5) Pattern-to-scale fitness — is the architectural pattern (monolith, modular, service, layered, event-driven) appropriate for the project's current size and growth trajectory?
>
> For each finding: run Chesterton check (git log, ADRs, inline docs). Rationale found → skip. Not found → report with all 4 required fields. Verdict: Justified | Questionable | Unjustified.
>
> Write raw output to `$FORGE_DIR/raw/A.md`. Research only, no writes to source files.

---

**Agent B — Design Philosophy & Intra-Module Structure**

OWNS: Within-module design quality — paradigm fit, patterns, code smells as structural signals.
DELEGATES: cross-module coupling root cause → A; boundary/interface design → C.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial design critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN intra-module structure. Cross-module coupling goes to A. Interface/contract design goes to C. A code smell that signals a coupling issue between modules (e.g., Feature Envy) should be named here as the surface signal, but root cause attribution in the report goes to A.
>
> Auto-detect paradigm per module before applying principles.
>
> For OOP modules: (1) SOLID violations — name the specific principle and the specific class; (2) inheritance used for code reuse instead of composition; (3) design pattern cargo-cult — pattern applied without solving the problem it was designed to solve; (4) DDD model anemia — domain objects as data bags with logic scattered in service layers.
>
> For FP modules: (5) impure functions embedded in pure pipelines without isolation; (6) mutable state smuggled into otherwise-pure code; (7) over-abstraction — point-free style beyond readability; (8) missing appropriate monadic patterns where error/async is handled ad-hoc.
>
> For all paradigms: (9) Fowler code smells as structural signals — Shotgun Surgery, Divergent Change, Speculative Generality, Primitive Obsession, Data Clumps, Parallel Hierarchies; (10) Brooks' conceptual integrity — is there one coherent design philosophy throughout, or does each file look like a different author's style guide?
>
> For each finding: Chesterton check first. All 4 required fields or drop.
>
> Write raw output to `$FORGE_DIR/raw/B.md`. Research only, no writes to source files.

---

**Agent C — Interface & Contract Design**

OWNS: What modules expose at their boundaries and how they communicate failure.
DELEGATES: inter-module coupling direction → A; intra-module structure → B.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial interface critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN boundary and contract design. If coupling is the primary issue (which module imports which), that belongs to A. If internal structure is the primary issue, that belongs to B.
>
> Interrogate: (1) Bloch's API principles — is the public surface minimal? Are common cases simple and uncommon cases possible? Do methods encourage correct use and make misuse difficult? (2) Postel's Law application — is input acceptance appropriately strict or permissive for the context? (3) Connascence at boundaries — are modules coupled by meaning (shared magic values, implicit conventions), by position (argument order must match), or by algorithm (caller must know implementation details to use the interface)? (4) Error handling philosophy at boundaries — do functions communicate failure clearly and consistently? Is the strategy (exceptions / error codes / null / Result/Option types) consistent across the codebase and appropriate for the language? (5) Interface evolution — are public interfaces stable? Is there a deprecation strategy for breaking changes? (6) Multi-consumer API contracts — the REST API is consumed by an Angular admin AND a Flutter app that ship independently, so ask whether the contract is expressed anywhere a client can rely on (schema/OpenAPI, versioning or additive-only policy, error-shape convention, explicit money and date serialisation), or whether each client is left to infer it from the current response.

**Agent D — Complexity & Cognitive Budget**

OWNS: Cognitive cost of the code — how hard it is to hold in working memory.
DELEGATES: complexity caused by inter-module coupling → A (flag the cost here, root in A); complexity caused by internal structure → B (flag the cost here, root in B). D owns the cognitive *measure* independently.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial complexity critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN cognitive complexity. You measure and quantify it. Root causes of that complexity belong to A or B — you may note the root but the canonical finding stays here.
>
> Interrogate: (1) Ousterhout's deep vs. shallow modules — does each module hide significant complexity behind a simple interface, or does it expose complexity without absorbing any? (2) Essential vs. accidental complexity — which complexity is inherent to the problem domain vs. introduced by design choices that could be reversed? (3) YAGNI violations — generality added for hypothetical requirements that never materialized; hooks, extension points, and abstractions with zero or one consumer; (4) Naming as cognitive proxy — do names reveal intent clearly enough that the implementation rarely needs to be read? Identify names that force readers into the implementation; (5) Working-memory pressure — code units too large to hold in context at once (> ~50 lines for a function without a compelling reason), mixed abstraction levels in one function, unexpected side effects in reads/getters; (6) Cognitive load patterns — deeply nested conditionals (> 3 levels), early returns suppressed, boolean parameters that flip function behavior.

>
> Write raw output to `$FORGE_DIR/raw/D.md`. Research only, no writes to source files.

**Agent E — Concurrency & State**

OWNS: All concurrency and shared-state design findings. Orthogonal to A–D.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial concurrency critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN concurrency and state design. These concerns are orthogonal to structural layering (A–D).
>
> Auto-detect paradigm. In FP-dominant code, check for impure mutations. In OOP-dominant code, check for synchronization and state machine design.
>
> Interrogate: (1) Shared mutable state — any state accessible by multiple concurrent actors without explicit synchronization? (2) Race susceptibility — operations assuming sequential execution in a concurrent context: TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use), check-then-act, read-modify-write; (3) Immutability strategy — is mutability the default or the exception? Are mutable data structures passed across thread/process boundaries? (4) State machine design — for stateful components, is state modeled explicitly (enum, sealed class, state machine library) or implicitly (boolean flags, nullable fields signaling state)? (5) Async/reactive design — are async boundaries explicit? Are there blocking calls inside async/reactive contexts? Is backpressure handled or ignored?

**Agent F — Data & Persistence Design**

OWNS: Data model and persistence concerns. Orthogonal to A–E.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial data design critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN data model and persistence design. These concerns are orthogonal to structural layering.
>
> Interrogate: (1) Data model fit — is the data model (relational, document, graph, key-value, time-series) appropriate for the access patterns? Are there signs of impedance mismatch between the model and its queries? (2) ORM anti-patterns — N+1 queries, lazy-loading inside loops, raw SQL leaking through repository boundaries into domain code; (3) Repository pattern quality — do repositories abstract the storage engine so domain code has no storage-specific knowledge? (4) Schema evolvability — is the schema designed for forward/backward compatibility? Are migrations reversible? Is there a rollback plan for each migration? (5) Read/write model separation — are read-heavy and write-heavy paths sharing a model when separating them would reduce coupling? Is event sourcing applied where snapshotting would serve equally well at lower complexity cost? (6) Money and tenancy in the schema — is monetary value stored in a type that cannot silently lose a cent (integer minor units or fixed-scale decimal, never float), with currency carried alongside the amount and the document's own exchange rate stored on the document? Is tenant scoping enforced structurally (a mandatory scoped repository, a session-level policy) or left to every caller to remember — the latter is a structural finding, not a code smell. (7) Accounting immutability — does the model let an issued document's number, date or totals be mutated in place, where the domain says corrections are new documents?

**Agent G — Resilience & Evolution**

OWNS: How well the system handles failure and absorbs structural change. Orthogonal to A–F.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial resilience critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN resilience and evolution design. These concerns are orthogonal to structural layering.
>
> Interrogate: (1) Extension points — can new behavior be added without modifying existing code (Open/Closed principle applied at the system level)? Are the right extension seams present, or does every new feature require shotgun changes? (2) Backwards compatibility — are breaking changes made without a deprecation path or migration guide? (3) Failure isolation — do component failures cascade, or are they bounded by bulkheads? Is circuit breaker or retry applied where appropriate? (4) Graceful degradation — does the system have a defined degraded-mode strategy, or is it all-or-nothing? (5) Feature flag readiness — can features be toggled without deployment? Is there a kill switch for new behavior? (6) Migration reversibility — are data and schema migrations designed to be rolled back, or are they one-way?

**Agent H — Testability & Observability Design**

OWNS: Whether the structure enables testing and production insight. Orthogonal to A–G. Note: this agent critiques *structural choices* that make testing or observing hard — not test coverage gaps (that is `/inspect` Agent F).

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial testability and observability critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN testability and observability design. You critique structural choices that make testing or observing the system hard, not test coverage gaps (that is /inspect Agent F).
>
> Interrogate testability: (1) Dependency injection — are dependencies injected (constructor/parameter injection), or are they hardcoded/global (making substitution in tests require monkey-patching or environment tricks)? (2) Test seam availability — can the system be put into a known state without running all of production infrastructure? Are there seams for substituting collaborators (time, randomness, I/O, external services)? (3) Determinism — are there hidden sources of non-determinism (wall-clock time, randomness, external API calls) reachable from pure business logic without isolation?
>
> Interrogate observability: (4) Log design — are logs structured (JSON/key-value)? Do they carry correlation/request IDs? Can a single request be traced end-to-end across components using only logs? (5) Error propagation — when a failure occurs deep in the stack, does the error surface with enough context (original cause, input values, component name) to diagnose without source access? (6) Instrumentation points — are the right metrics and tracing spans present for production diagnosis, or would a production incident require a code change to investigate?

**Agent I — UX/Presentation Layer**

OWNS: Design-time presentation quality — view-state coverage, component composition, design-time accessibility, UX pattern consistency.
DELEGATES: intra-module code smells → B; interface/contract design → C; runtime WCAG contrast/ARIA/keyboard-order (requires a running browser) → qa-sweep (never raise these as forge findings).
CONDITIONAL: if `PROJECT_TYPE` contains no frontend indicator files (`.html`, `.ts` + `.component.html` for Angular, `.dart` for Flutter, `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, or a Twig/PDF template dir), write `$FORGE_DIR/raw/I.md` with `NO FRONTEND DETECTED — Agent I skipped.` and return immediately. twes-in has THREE presentation surfaces when they exist — the Angular admin, the Flutter app, and the rendered invoice/quote/credit PDF — and the third counts: a document template is a presentation layer with no interactivity but real layout, i18n and overflow behaviour.

> Analyze `<TARGET>` as an adversarial UX/presentation critic. PROJECT_TYPE: PROJECT_TYPE. ADR_CONTEXT: ADR_CONTEXT. CURRENT_DATE.
>
> You OWN the presentation layer. Intra-module code smells belong to B. Interface/contract design belongs to C. Runtime measurements (contrast ratios, ARIA tree, keyboard tab-order) require a running browser and belong to qa-sweep — do NOT raise these as forge findings.
>
> First: check whether frontend indicator files exist (Angular: `.html`/`.ts`/`.scss`; Flutter: `.dart`; document templates: the PDF/Twig template dir). If none found, write `NO FRONTEND DETECTED — Agent I skipped.` to your output file and stop.
>
> Interrogate: (1) View-state coverage — for every interactive component or data-fetching unit, does the source define distinct loading, error, and empty states? Missing any of the three is a design gap. (2) Component composition — is data passed more than 2 levels deep via props without an explicit context/store mechanism? Flag prop-drilling chains of 3+ levels as a structural finding. (3) Design-time accessibility — are interactive non-native elements (div, span, li used as buttons/links) missing explicit `role` and keyboard handler attributes in source? Are form inputs missing associated labels in markup? Is `:focus` or `:focus-visible` defined in CSS for custom interactive elements? (4) UX pattern consistency — are error messages surfaced with the same visual pattern across all components? Do destructive actions (delete, reset, overwrite) require explicit confirmation in the component logic?
>
> For each finding: Chesterton check first (git log, ADRs, inline docs). Rationale found → skip. Not found → report with all 4 required fields (named principle + concrete alternative + cost-to-change + cost-to-keep). All 4 fields required or drop the finding.

> Write raw output to `$FORGE_DIR/raw/I.md`. Research only, no writes to source files.

## Step 3: Synthesis Agent S

After all analysis agents complete (or after the single focused agent if `--focus` was used), spawn exactly one synthesis agent. This agent sees all raw outputs simultaneously and is responsible for enforcing the ownership partition.

> You are the synthesis agent for `/forge`. Read all raw analysis files from `$FORGE_DIR/raw/` (A.md through I.md, or the subset that was run).
>
> **First: inventory raw files**. Run `ls "$FORGE_DIR/raw/"` and note which agent letters are present. For any expected agent whose file is missing (e.g., raw/C.md absent when agents A–E were supposed to run), add to the Summary section: `**Missing agents**: [C] — raw file not written (agent may have timed out or been rate-limited). Findings from this agent are absent from this report.` Do not fabricate findings for missing agents.
>
> **Primary responsibility**: The analysis agents ran in parallel and could not see each other's output. The same underlying structural fact may appear in multiple raw files under different principle names. You must deduplicate before producing the final report.
>
> **Deduplication rule**: For any underlying structural fact appearing in 2+ raw files, assign it to the single agent whose ownership rule most precisely matches the root nature of the finding. Collapse all other mentions into an "Also flagged by: [agents]" annotation on the canonical entry. When in doubt, use this ownership quick-reference:
> - Cross-module coupling / dependency direction → A
> - Intra-module design / code smells → B
> - Boundary/interface/contract design → C
> - Cognitive complexity / abstraction cost → D
> - Concurrency / shared state → E
> - Data model / persistence → F
> - Resilience / evolution / extension → G
> - Testability / observability design → H
> - UX/presentation layer (view-states, component composition, design-time a11y) → I
>
> **Drop incomplete findings**: Any finding in a raw file that lacks all 4 required fields (named principle + concrete alternative + cost-to-change + cost-to-keep) must be dropped from the final report. Do not include partial findings.
>
> **Report format**:
>
> ```markdown
> # /forge Report — <TARGET> — <DATE>
>
> ## Summary
> - **Agents run**: [letters]
> - **Total findings**: N (Unjustified: X | Questionable: Y)
> - **Highest-signal lens**: [agent letter — most Unjustified/Questionable findings]
> - **Deduplication**: M findings collapsed across agents
>
> ## Findings
>
> (Sorted: Unjustified first, then Questionable. Justified findings are omitted — they are silent successes.)
>
> ### [A] — [Short title of structural decision being challenged]
> **Verdict**: Unjustified | Questionable
> **Chesterton check**: [what was searched, what was or wasn't found in git/ADRs/docs]
> **Paradigm context**: [OOP / FP / procedural / mixed OOP+FP — which applies here and why]
> **Principle violated**: [named authority + specific principle — e.g., "Parnas (1972) — information hiding: the module exposes its sorting algorithm as part of its public interface"]
> **Location**: [file(s) + approximate line(s)]
> **Concrete alternative**: [specific better structure + 2-sentence implementation sketch]
> **Cost to change**: Low / Medium / High
> **Cost to keep**: [one sentence on coupling tax, cognitive tax, or evolution risk]
> **Also flagged by**: [other agents if deduplication merged entries — omit if not merged]
>
> ---
>
> ## Action List
>
> (One line per Unjustified or Questionable finding)
> - [ ] [A] Rename module X to expose only its interface, not its algorithm
> - [ ] [C] Replace positional argument coupling in Y with named config struct
> ```
>
> Write the final report to `$REPORT_PATH`. Announce the path when done. Research only, no writes to source files.

## Step 4: Announce

After the synthesis agent completes:

```
Forge complete → $REPORT_PATH

Findings: N total (X Unjustified, Y Questionable, Z Justified/dropped)
Deduplication: M cross-agent findings collapsed
Top findings:
  1. [agent] [title] — Unjustified
  2. [agent] [title] — Questionable
  3. [agent] [title] — Questionable

This report is read-only. Nothing was modified.
